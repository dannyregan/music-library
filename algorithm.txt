Create a User class that will handle requests to change user-specific information.
Create a class that initializes the music library program altogether.
Loop indefinitely calling the menu method from this class to display a menu. Provide relevant options like adding a user.
When the user adds a new user, or decides to change users, we'll need to store this information so that the program can call methods from the correct instance of the User class.
The user's selection from this menu will call the associated method from the program class.
These methods will gather relevant information about the requested method (if the user wants to add a new user, this part of the app will collect the new username, for example).
The method then calls a relevant method from the User class, passing relevant data such as a new username or song title and artist.
These methods alter information for a specific, selected instance of the User class.
There's an option to break the menu loop and terminate the program whenever the user is finished.
